```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


I began by loading the `tidyverse` package.


I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.




# Section 3


```{r learning_chunk}


df = tibble(
  rs = rnorm(500, mean = 1)
  , logi = rs > 0
  , abso = abs(rs)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x = abso)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)
```



Create a buleted list with the mean, median, and sd of the sample.

* `r mean(samp)`
* `r median(samp)`
* `r sd(samp)`

```{r}

# apparently R sucked before R Markdown, which I absolutely believe




```
